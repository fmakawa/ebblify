The other day I was involved in a conversation concerning my efforts on crowdfunding my Master’s degree. At the time I had mentioned that I hadn’t received as much traction I would like and the friend I was talking to pointed out (and everyone agreed) that I had a snowball’s chance in hell of raising the amount I needed because I didn’t fit the narrative. My story isn’t the atypical African story that you see plastered all over the internet, in the news and every charity or organization doing work in Africa. I don’t have the look of some child suffering from malnutrition and starvation as is often seen in images Ethiopia and Eritrea, I’m not a former child soldier and Kony isn’t my local overlord, my parents didn’t die of AIDS or political turmoil and I’m not an orphan as my parents are both alive and well. Admittedly I do come from a country that hasn’t had a good decade and a half, I am Zimbabwean.
<br>
My story really isn’t unique; it actually fits the narrative of the majority of Africa.....{% endblocktrans %}</p>

				<p>{% blocktrans%}I’d known all along that there were things that Eric had left unsaid, business being what it was I understood but then again he was meant  to be a civilian so business wasn’t meant to a factor. He’d introduced himself a while back, at some backwater pub I’d been drinking off my cotton mouth from the previous night, he looked like a nice fellow, who liked the drink as much as I did but without the cynicism that drove me to it. He’d said he was an analyst for bitco, the bank that jumped on the crypto-currency bandwagon way back in the new millennium when they still used paper money and was the big chief about here parts with their pudgy bejewelled fingers in about every pot. I’d let him sit with me and buy me a drink or two and we’d swapped a story or two. For a desk jockey he seemed to get around but there was an air about him, there was something a little off about his jovial nature, a little put on, a shroud to hide the steel beneath. You had to look closely and know what you were looking for; the occasional quick scan of the room, back always to the wall, the hard glint in his eye that would pop up when something unexpected would happen although it was quick to disappear, but what sealed it was the tension. Eric was a tightly coiled spring, you could feel the power and grace hidden in that deceptively lanky frame. I picked that up when I’d bumped into him in a drunken stumble one night through Woodstock. I’d caught him unawares but even then I barely caught him.  He’d looked at me with surprise and then tried sheepishly to cover up his rather quick reflexes for a guy who was meant to be two sheets to the wind and barely on two feet. He’d kept his distance since and I sobered up mighty quickly after that my mind whirring trying to figure out what his angle was and what really was his story. Over time I’d let the incident pass and put it down to old habits lulled perhaps by the slightly spiky hair, the rumpled shirt and coat as if he’d slept at the desk, the lax tie and quick laugh at anything remotely funny and the not so funny. An easy guy to please but sitting here on this dank couch, with the green dragon working through my system I watched him work over the Russian it gave me a little bit of the chills. I thought I knew but watching him now I knew I knew nothing at all. There was a game afoot, not even the game I’d been playing and I’d been brought along to either play the patsy or the dove or the dame or god forbid all of them. I needed to figure out before he hit pay dirt and this went the way of Nero.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

				<p>{% blocktrans %} It’s 8.15 on Sunday morning, I’m cold, a little hungry, a bit uneasy because Dave is 15 minutes late and isn’t picking up his phone and he has my ticket, Em and crew have already started and I don’t know if I’ll be able to catch up and lastly, the large crowd makes me uncomfortable. The over riding thought is ‘what the hell am I doing here?’. I know it’s for the kids but I could have just donated the money and not having had to sacrifice one of my very few and precious free sunday mornings to run 10km I hadn’t prepared for. I could walk but that’s not my style. I run. Its cold too, Cape Town weather having decided to not come to the party. Its not just about the money I tell myself, its about showing support for the initiative I continue telling myself, its about these sacrifices we make however small or large I went on. I lay it thick and fast so as to counter my traitorous minds attempt to get me back to my car and off home. I almost fail so I changed tack. Smart fox you. I say ‘but you made a promise. What will Em think? Or Aliyah? Or Ntando?’. All resistance crumbles at this point, there is that subtle menacing reminder/threat in that statement, that it is more than just about my word. So here I am, standing at McDonald’s outside the white elephant that is the Greenpoint Stadium waiting for Dave to bring my last minute sign up ticket, in the cold, really wishing I didn’t value my word or what people thought of me. I check the time again and call Dave for the umpteenth time. I swear if Dave doesn’t make it with that ticket and makes me look like a spaz I’ll flay him to death. This leads me to rather amusing albeit morbid speculation on the techniques one uses in the subtle art of flaying. That takes up an additional 2 minutes. I look at the time again. I contemplate calling again even if by now I’ve concluded that it won’t help. I drift of again as I speculate what other form of retribution I could use and just as I am discarding castration he arrives. My relief is palpable.
<br>
After giving me my ticket and distributing the other tickets Dave promptly strips down into shorts and a running vest and announces ‘I’ll do it in 50’. I’m like ‘really?”Yeah, 50, that’s the target’. In my head I’m like ‘pfft, 50,pfft. Yeah right‘. The announcer informs us the race is about to begin so we begin to form up at the starting area. Within minutes the race starts and I’ve already lost Dave. I try to find some room to begin to run but its rather cramped and people are preferring to walk so there isn’t much room to move about. It seems the only place you can run is by the fringe so I move there and my run finally begins. 30 minutes behind Em who is doing the 15km, 30 minutes too long in the cold but that didn’t matter anymore as the bottom line was it was time to run. I started a brisk pace weaving in and out of the crowds. I spotted Dave as he ran past me and since I knew I was not going to keep up I decided to use this one group of runners wearing reflective jackets and moving at steady pace just ahead as my marker. As long as I kept them in sight I was okay. The first 3 km go along just fine, not too challenging but I can already feel my body tell me that I’m going to hit a wall soon enough and it was not going to be pretty. I don’t care, I even up it a little still hoping I could catch up to the gang. Oh foolish fox! I am so nonchalant about it that I even start tweeting. If only I knew. So here I am just after the 3km mark running at a steady pace, tweeting mid stride, a few rays of sunlight streaming through the clouds and a little out of breath but feeling like I own the this little piece of the world. It isn’t long after that my ankle decides it doesn’t like this constant beat I am playing on the tarmac and gives out, my thighs and calves decide they too have had enough. All those already forgotten regrets from earlier come back in full force. I want out but the only way now was to just continue. By the 5km mark fatigue has set in and after turning round for the return leg I change my routine to intermittently walking and running with the odd limp. It meant I can still move at a steady clip but that I can also nurse my now throbbing ankle.
<br>
When before I had been scanning the crowds for eye candy now I scan the distance hoping that somehow I’d reached the finish line. And it as I scan the horizon yet again and lo!, there was Jo, an old crush I had back in High School and again when I randomly discovered that we were doing the same Anthropology program. I call out to her and we share a brief conversation. She’s here babysitting the St Cyprian’s girls showing their support and she looks lovely in the morning chill, flushed cheeks and all and in that tight running gear. Rather chirpy too and I all I can summon is biting sarcasm and some increasing questioning of my sanity for waking up this early on one of my rare free sunday mornings. It shows. And because I’m aware of this I wonder why on earth I flagged her down knowing I’d only be putting my worst foot forward. The conversation ends, there is a run to be had after all, so I sigh in exasperation and continue the run. Having turned round at the 5 km mark I can see the full distance I have to run back and I’m not pleased. I can set small goals but they are rather pointless as I compare them to the what now seems as a vast expanse left. Never again will I run a long race, long as in more than 5 km, that throughout I can see the finish line. It is the most dispiriting thing ever. I’ll take my blind corners and seemingly worthwhile short objectives that give me a sense of achievement thank you very much. I’m no longer running, Em, Jess and crew now long forgotten. I’m tired and I’ve resigned myself to seeing them at the end. All I can think of is the lady in front of me with the cute arse who looks like a doppelganger of Vix and the man in his sixties power walking at a pace I wish I could run at this moment or any other moment. He is one fit geriatric. If I am that fit at his age Death will have to sit out and wait for quite a while yet. I’ve now passed the lighthouse and on the final stretch of real road and from nowhere pops up this gent with the oddest power walk gait; legs mostly straight hardly bending, arse out and up, chest puffed up and arms swinging vigorously. He slows down and tries to initiate a conversation. I’m tired, I try not to show my irritation but its sapping what remaining energy I have left. He begins this long winded story about how he should have been in London instead of the young twerps they sent, how he is a timed power walker who competes, is a motivational speaker, a manager of a football club etc all in this irritating high pitched voice. Thanks to him, I tap a hitherto unknown source of energy just to get way from him. So I run. I wish for death but I run. That last stretch was a killer but I run because I feared he would catch me and tell me more. It didn’t help either that at the end they have some people cheering, more like cajoling me to the end. I don’t need it. I already have all the incentive I needed. It all serves to grate my already frayed nerves. I cross the finish line and instead of relief my first instinct is to grab a cup of coke and immediately get lost in the crowd. I didn’t want that annoying man to catch me. I could hear him behind me shouting out loud to someone ‘I beat you! I did! I just passed you now’ in that high pitched voice of his. I want out. Just beyond the finish line I find Dave. I thought I hadn’t done too badly, 1hr 15min for the 10km and here was Dave sitting rather relaxed having done it in 50min. I want to kill him but I am too beat even to indulge that thought.
<br>
Eventually, like 45 minutes later the gang trudge in. By then I am cold, hungry and the runner’s high a forgotten memory but then thanking god that despite the name, I had no blisters.

Blisters for Bread is a charity run held every year in Cape Town that uses the funds raised to feed school going children in and around the Western Cape. It said each entrance fee feeds 18 children. The rationale: you can’t teach hungry kids.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
